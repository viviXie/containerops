### Commit Style

Simple house-keeping for clean git history.
Read more on [How to Write a Git Commit Message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/) or the Discussion section of [`git-commit(1)`](http://git-scm.com/docs/git-commit).

1. Separate the subject from body with a blank line
2. Limit the subject line to 50 characters
3. Capitalize the subject line
4. Do not end the subject line with a period
5. Use the imperative mood in the subject line
6. Wrap the body at 72 characters
7. Use the body to explain what and why vs. how
  * If there was important/useful/essential conversation or information, copy or include a reference
8. When possible, one keyword to scope the change in the subject (i.e. "README: ...", "runtime: ...")
