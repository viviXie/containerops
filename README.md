# ContainerOps - DevOps Orchestration

## What's ContainerOps?

> ContainerOps is a DevOps orchestration.


There is many projects, plugins, services in the DevOps workflow. However, no one covers all DevOps tasks, and we could only choose different projects and services together assembling into DevOps workflow. How to determine the order and pass the context between them?  In the DevOps need orchestration for improving efficiency and iteration speed. 

ContainerOps is DevOps orchestration. It builds a DevOps workflow orchestrating tools or services, and giving the trigger data or customizes data from the workflow start trigger to the every stage. So donâ€™t need to abandon the original DevOps solution, just add ContainerOps as the top orchestration, scheduling the existing build system, continuous integration system or continuous deployment system, adding any features used and reused container DevOps component.

> What's the DevOps component?

ContainerOps provide a specification about how to encapsulate the DevOps task into a container. A DevOps function developed in any programming language like Bash, Golang, Python or C++ could encapsulate as a containerized DevOps component. This guarantee that the DevOps task always run the same, regardless of its environment.

> Drawing the DevOps Workflow.

The ContainerOps has a DevOps workflow WYSIWYG editor in the browser. The user could define the DevOps workflow by drag or drop the line or set the data flow from workflow trigger to the end by the same way.
