## ContainerOps - DevOps Orchestration

### ContainerOps is a DevOps orchestration platform with the container technology.

ContainerOps is a DevOps orchestration platform built with containers. It has an orchestrating engine to drive components or services, and runs on Kubernetes. ContainerOps provides tools to encapsulate plugins or any programs into a container, and a set of environment variables are used for interaction with the engine. We call this container encapsulated DevOps task a component. All components run in Kubernetes, and the lifecycle of the tasks are managed by the engine. At the same time, the engine can be integrated with DevOps services like Github or Travis CI through REST API. The ContainerOps is designed for cloud native app development and runs within container cluster.
